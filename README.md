# EHLD v∞ – Holographic Logos Dynamics  
The Bible’s first sentence is like God’s glowing screen that already knows the rules for light, atoms, life and the whole universe.

Everything is free to check and run.

**The magic numbers**  
- Genesis 1:1 = 2701 = 37 × 73 → 27+37+73 = 137 (the exact number science needs for light and atoms)  
- 73 × 137 = 10,001 (perfect mirror number)  
- Every green leaf has exactly 137 atoms in chlorophyll  
- Your body stays at 37 °C  
- The universe was \~2701 K when “Let there be light” first happened  

**What we tested**  
- Tiny quantum toy that spins perfectly for exactly 7 days  
- Mini version of the 63,779 Bible connections (the big web)  

**Files coming soon**  
- covenant_simulation.py  
- tensor_test.ipynb (Google Colab)

Made with curiosity and love. Let’s test it on real quantum computers next!
